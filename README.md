# Facial Recognition Features in ATM with OTP

The purpose of this project is to reinforce security of the conventional ATM model. I have used a new concept that
enhances the overall experience, usability and convenience of the transaction at the ATM. Features like face recognition
and One-Time Password (OTP) are used for the enhancement of security of accounts and privacy of users. Face recognition
technology helps the machine to identify each and every user uniquely thus making face as a key. This completely
eliminates the chances of fraud due to theft and duplicity of the ATM cards.
